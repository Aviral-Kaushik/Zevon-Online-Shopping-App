# Zevon-Online-Shopping-App
Zevon is an E-commerce platform for shopping. This Application includes all the features that needs for an E-commerce application.

In this application, I have used firebase realtime database for handling the user data and used firebase cloud storage for storing images and videos of the user.

I have used Kotlin as a backend langauage for developing this applicationa and used XML for making the UI of this application.

In this application, I have also implemented animation for better user experience.

In this application, a user can apply for becoming a seller and after becoming a selller the user can sell its own product on Zevon.
